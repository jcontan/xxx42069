            <h1>O GRANDPA! MY GRANDPA!</h1>
            <p class="author"><a href="https://twitter.com/St_Geven">Steven Popa</a></p>
            <p class="date">September 5, 2023</p>

<p>he opens his fat mouth and says --<br>
you'll understand better when you're my age</p>
           
<p>he's always saying stuff like that<br>
stuff that makes me feel small and weak and young<br>
but what can i say<br>
you only get one Grandpa in this life<br>
and i love the guy<br>
though supposedly he’s had trouble shutting up<br>
ever since grandma died or left him or whatever it was<br>
i don't remember what he told me<br>
just that it happened before i was born and maybe in connecticut</p>

<p>yes sirree when you’re my age then you’ll know --<br>
he keeps going on and on<br>
i wonder when he'll stop and start the prayer so we can eat<br>
because i'm so bored right now<br>
i'm so bored and i might as well eat</p>

<p>i blink a few times and look over at my sister<br>
she looks up from her pockets and smiles as if to tell me not to worry<br>
soon Grandpa will finish up his colon lecture --</p>

<p>but you've got to let them just keep pumping you full of enemas<br>
that's the only way they can cure you of all your dirty thoughts speaking of assholes<br>
shouldn't somebody start praying to god already? --</p>

<p>and then he's off on one of his pious escapades to the high mountains of religious<br>
contemplation<br>
soaring far above the streams of wisdom and fruit of knowledge<br>
knowing full well that getting to the mountaintop extra dry and thirsty earns you bonus points<br>
with the big man<br>
in typical Grandpa fashion he finishes the prayer before we’ve understood a single word --</p>

<p>god is dead<br>
long live god<br>
amen</p>

<p>so we munch and slobber and cough and swallow until the whole damn table is a mess<br>
but at least it's mostly empty<br>
i look at the fat old man as he picks at his teeth with a fork<br>
and sudden emotion overcomes me as i cry out --</p>

<p>Grandpa do you really think i'll ever get to be as old as you are honestly</p>

<p>he leans forward in his chair and i'm not sure if it's wood or bones that are creaking<br>
i hear hissy laughter like a girl<br>
like my sister and i even look at her<br>
but it's not her it’s the old coot<br>
and he starts spitting sneezing squealing and pounding his fists on the table and stomping his<br>
feet on the floor<br>
and it’s grotesque but he's pretty good at it<br>
for a man of his age and mental ability<br>
there’s something musical especially once<br>
he belches<br>
flatulates<br>
regurgitates<br>
even masturbates<br>
all there at the dinner table<br>
but it feels like the circus is in town<br>
so i start stomping and clapping and laughing<br>
and now i’m getting louder than he is<br>
so he slaps me across the forehead<br>
messing my toupee<br>
and he finally says --</p>

<p>you've never really listened to me before have you<br>
but i want you to start listening<br>
i want you to start paying attention to every word i utter<br>
start right now<br>
because i love you<br>
and the answer is yes</p>

<p>my sister takes away the dishes<br>
but i don't even notice her<br>
because i'm too busy looking at Grandpa<br>
listening as he gives me advice<br>
and watching everything he does<br>
even when he goes into my sister's room at night and i think<br>
i want to be just like him when i grow up</p>
